# unet-architecture-study
A structured exploration of U-Net architectures and their impact on multiclass segmentation performance. This repo investigates architectural choices — including skip connections, loss functions (Dice, Focal), ASPP modules, and ResNet backbones — and illustrates how each modification affects model outputs both quantitatively and visually.
